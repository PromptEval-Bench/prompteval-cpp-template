# This script creates a file named README.md in the same directory
# where the script is run. It then writes the string "HelloWorld"
# into that file.

# If README.md already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
# If it does not exist, it will be created.

echo "HelloWorld" > README.md

# The script will then exit. You can verify its success by
# checking the contents of README.md.
